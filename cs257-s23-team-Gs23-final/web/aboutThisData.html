    <h2 id="why">Why Crime?</h2>
    <p>This crime dataset was one of the first we encountered, and we spend a long time exploring it for fun. Our initial curiosity and eagerness led us to explore the crime statistics for our home states. However, as we delved deeper, we began to realize the practical uses and implications of this data for areas such as journalism, politics, etc. Compared to other lighthearted datasets, we recognized the importance and significance of studying and learning from crime data. Motivated by its relevance, we decided to use this dataset for our website project.  </p>

    <h2 id="why">Why Minnesota?</h2>
    <p>When we began searching through the comprehensive crime data folder we downloaded, we encountered a multitude of nested state and national files, many with their own formatting and content. Among them, the national file stood out, containing comprehensive crime statistics, population, and city-level data for the entire United States (with a few exceptions). Additionally, the state files offered access to valuable demographic information. Considering the scope and complexity of our project, though, we made the decision to focus on the national file filtered by cities.</p>
    <p>However, as we are based in Minnesota and wanted to add a touch of local relevance, we chose to add its state data. Including detailed data for every state would have been far too time-consuming. By selecting Minnesota's state files, we were able to strike a balance between comprehensive nationwide coverage and a localized perspective. This allowed us to incorporate interesting and relevant information about crime in our own community while still providing a broader understanding of crime trends across the United States.</p>

<div class="content">
    <h2 id="why">What does the dataset look like?</h2>
    <p>The nationwide data we are utilizing is organized by city and by state with the number of offenses occurred in each city being the central pieces of data. The offenses are divided up into two categories: violent offenses and property offenses. This page from the <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement">FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program</a> goes into more detail.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Violent Offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault</li>
        <li>Property Offenses: burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data we have on Minnesota goes more in depth into the demographics of offenders on the state level. We chose to focus on age, sex, ethnicity, race, and types of weapons used though the <a href="https://cde-prd-data.s3.us-gov-east-1.amazonaws.com/NIBRS_DataDictionary.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQC732REK4T4WIMN5%2F20230517%2Fus-gov-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230517T235838Z&X-Amz-Expires=900&X-Amz-Security-Token=FwoDYXdzEE4aDCsadXRoCdfSHS9lzCKhAkdWjKkxVERa2f6MPDwy%2FJ3%2F6a9DTVHZ8EPGaohuJcUPlgnyG9jQClUPwhWGTpV1%2FdFbXSKnx9ZXySsb%2BxW4KFGsIAU8n53J9pWH39TwvJ2J%2Bw0D3k9ePGZ3iPnFKmIKs3pKJd2vniZ%2B%2BUT0zJO8EohE3shk%2FAKZspsHSPad%2FyksKw%2FQrJFekd3HC8BYY9WN9XJ19jdWEYe5ICYMoD32AiQ%2Fly3K21Gsjgj8zXGnP%2BF7Aw%2FbfWGC4e1%2BpZczS2xCIblmBpdfrflGUyyE04km8QV%2Fqt%2FNT%2BnyUfTRulsQhTlzNltvgGYtbNNixDRkR9D%2BAtzOXqKq4tq840uUT0i2t%2FADbG2xPKtqvkyFArxmM4LpIKMugsSZlyzPnh%2BK7%2Br7erUo7r%2BVowYyLeyuun4N2d8Q6n5aoabhHAym2UYpuGF6XPP%2FyEO7jNmN1ersgbESMa%2B4N3akqw%3D%3D&X-Amz-Signature=d565c8c9fc6bdcff42ee878b1665a630814f58a2f11b20780586067baf8b631b&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host">National Incident-Based Reporting System</a> (NIBRS) included even more information on each incident. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ethnicities: Hispanic or Latino, Not Hispanic or Latino, Multiple, Unknown, and Not Specified</li>
        <li>Races: Unknown, White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Multiple, and Not Specified</li>

<div class="content">
    <h2 id="why">Changes Made to Dataset</h2>
    <p>In our national offenses data, we did not change anything. In our Minnesota data, however, we consolidated some files so that we would include the text descriptions of the demographic data instead of the id numbers that were originally present: White instead of 10 or Handgun instead of 40 and so forth. This was just to decrease the complexity of our database calls, so that there was no joining of reference tables and our data tables needed.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <h2 id="why">Limitations</h2>
    <p>Notably, our national data is missing all statistics on Florida and District of Columbia (if it can be counted as a similar entity) as well as there being limited data on a few more states. The UCR reports from 2021 most likely had missing data because not all states' agencies had reported data for various reasons, possibly due to the states transferring over to the newer NIBRS over UCR. The dataset we downloaded had this at the bottom: "Limited data for 2021 were available for California, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Pennsylvania. "</p>

<div class="content">
    <h2 id="data">How should this data be used?</h2>
    <p>We highly discourage the use of statistics from this dataset without proper recognition of the wide range of factors that affect how much crime and of what type occurs in a location. Things such as population density, economic conditions, social and cultural factors, policies of the justice system, etc. all affect the crimes that people commit. The FBI created a <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use">document on responsible crime reporting</a>  that is worth checking out. 
        We also encourage everyone to further research the system's inability to consistently report accurate data based on inconsistent submission of data by individual agencies and the narrow crime definitions used among other things. Here is an <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2022/what-is-nibrs-new-fbi-data-explained/">article by Kelly McBride</a> on Poynter, a leading organization on reporting ethics and fact-based journalism, that hits this exact point.    </p>
